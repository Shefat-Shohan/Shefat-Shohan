Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Developer

I’m a frontend-focused full-stack developer with a strong eye for design, interactivity, and performance. I specialize in crafting modern, responsive user interfaces using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, with a deep understanding of product-driven development.

While my passion lies in frontend engineering, I also bring solid backend experience—designing scalable REST APIs with Node.js/Express, managing relational and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and implementing background job systems with BullMQ and Redis.

🔍 I’ve built production-ready AI SaaS platforms with:

✨ Prompt-based form & email generation

📊 Real-time sentiment analysis & feedback dashboards

🎥 Full-featured video platform with user auth, uploads, and recommendations

🔧 Core Stack:
React · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · TypeScript · Framer Motion
Node.js · Express.js · PostgreSQL · MongoDB · Redis · BullMQ
Cypress

Currently exploring AI automation, DSA.
